This project tracker is for LearnOqtane.com where you can LEARN | BUILD | DEPLOY | MONETIZE modules and themes on top of the Oqtane which is an open-source and cross-platform CMS and application framework

Over the past few months, I have been learning Oqtane which uses Blazor. I have also contributed to Oqtane by submitting pull requests which have been successfully merged into the framework. 

In my quest to learn Oqtane, I have built various themes and resources. I found it hard to find decent up-to-date tutorials or courses. Hence, I thought I would create LearnOqtane.com 

The goal of LearnOqtane.com is so that developers can LEARN | BUILD | DEPLOY | MONETIZE fast via video courses and tutorials. This project tracker will be a progress log so that you can get visibility on what I am working on and also be able to see which courses and tutorials are up and coming.
